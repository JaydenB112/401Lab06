# Animal Hierarchy

This C# code represents an animal hierarchy implemented with abstract classes and inheritance. The code models different animals, mammals, birds, and reptiles, with specific behaviors and properties for each category of animals.

## Abstract Classes

1. **Animal:** The base abstract class representing common properties and methods for all animals.
   - Abstract Methods: `MakeSound()`, `DrinkWater()`
   - Abstract Properties: `hasWings`, `Legs`

2. **Mammal:** An abstract class representing mammals, derived from the `Animal` class.
   - Abstract Method: `MammalBehavior()`
   - Abstract Property: `carnivore`

3. **Bird:** An abstract class representing birds, derived from the `Animal` class.
   - Abstract Method: `BirdBehavior()`
   - Abstract Property: `canFly`

## Concrete Classes

1. **Reptile:** Represents reptiles like snakes.
   - Overrides: `MakeSound()`, `DrinkWater()`, `HasTail()`, `hasWings`

2. **Elephant:** Represents elephants.
   - Overrides: `MakeSound()`, `DrinkWater()`, `hasWings`, `IsCarnivore`

3. **Lion:** Represents lions.
   - Overrides: `MakeSound()`, `DrinkWater()`, `hasWings`, `IsCarnivore`

4. **Hawk:** Represents hawks.
   - Overrides: `MakeSound()`, `DrinkWater()`, `HasTail()`, `HasFur`

5. **Mamba:** Represents mambas (a type of snake).
   - Overrides: `MakeSound()`, `DrinkWater()`, `HasTail()`, `HasFur`

## Virtual Methods and Properties

1. **Animal:**
   - Virtual Methods: `HasTail()`, `HasTeeth()`
   - Virtual Property: `HasFur`

2. **Mammal:**
   - Virtual Property: `hasWings`

## Output

The code demonstrates the creation of instances of various animals and their properties. The output displays information about each animal's behavior, sound, legs, whether it has fur, and whether it is a carnivore or can fly.

This is a summarized explanation of the animal hierarchy implemented in the C# code. The code leverages abstract classes and inheritance to create a flexible and extensible structure for modeling different types of animals and their behaviors.
